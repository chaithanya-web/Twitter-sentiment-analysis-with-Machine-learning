# Twitter-sentiment-analysis-with-Machine-learning
## The Twitter Sentiment Analysis project classifies tweets into Positive or Negative sentiments using machine learning techniques. A dataset of 1.6 million tweets was processed, and various NLP techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization were applied. Machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, SVM were trained and evaluated. The final model achieved 100% accuracy for both positive and negative tweets, indicating highly effective sentiment classification. Future improvements could include neutral sentiment classification, real-time sentiment tracking, and integration with a web-based tool for interactive analysis.
